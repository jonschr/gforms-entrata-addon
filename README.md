# Entrata for Gravity Forms

This plugin adds feeds capabilities for Entrata, using the [sendLeads API for Entrata](https://www.entrata.com/api/v1/documentation/sendLeads).

If you're having trouble using this, try using a free service like [PipeDream](https://pipedream.com/) to test your requests to get better visibility into what you're seeing. Failing that, you can enable logging for the Entrata Gforms addon, then check what responses you're getting from the Entrata API.
